# GenderDetection_Face
This project is NEU CSYE7374 Final Project, in this project, we are trying to approach a precise binary classification between biological males and females.    

This project supports the following objectives:
Choose an algorithm to implement gender detection (CNN and ANN?)
Optimize performance through parallelism (multi-CPU)
Experimental support
Analysis
conclusion


Dataset:
This dataset contains 2280 cropped faces (1140 male and 1140 female), and it is the dataset of Kaggle labeled with face gender recognition in 2018, which collected from the color face images of celebrities from the Internet in Europe and U.S, and the dataset have different factors such as illumination, wearing glasses, the head part. 

Methodology: 
ANN, CNN models
Tensorflow, keras, OpenCV, OpenMP
